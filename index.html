    <h1>Aaron Charlton, PhD, MBA<br>Marketing Researcher</h1> 
    <p>I am a marketing research with experience in both industry and academia. My research is mainly focused on improving evidence quality in the field of marketing (check out my site: <a href="https://openmkt.org/">OpenMKT.org</a>). I've taught courses on various marketing topics, including digital marketing, marketing communications and marketing research. I've developed a <a href="https://realworldclients.com/">free-to-use curriculum for working with real-world clients</a>. Prior to focusing on marketing research, I was an expert digital marketing analyst, which skills I've kept up over time through various client projects.</p>
