# aaroncharlton.github.io
This is my site. It is hosted at <a href="https://aaroncharlton.com/">aaroncharlton.com</a>. My goal was to simplify. Now I mainly link to all my projects and just have a one-page site. Note that I also have a 404 page but it's pretty basic too.
### Skins
There are multiple skins. To change out the skin you can swap out the skin css file in between the <head></head> tags in the HTML of both index.html and 404.html. 
For example, you can replace ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/skins/smokygray.css">``` with ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/skins/red.css">```

### About the CV link
You can just link to the Google Doc where you maintain your resume or cv. The link can be configured to <a href="https://eduk8.me/2016/06/link-google-doc-view-pdf-browser/">automatically export the doc as a pdf and download it</a>.
### License
The code is free for anybody to use.
