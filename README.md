This is my site. My goal was to simplify. Now I mainly link to all my projects and just have a one-page site. Note that I also have a 404 page but it's pretty basic too.
### About the CV link
You can just link to the Google Doc where you maintain your resume or cv. The link can be configured to <a href="https://eduk8.me/2016/06/link-google-doc-view-pdf-browser/">automatically export the doc as a pdf and download it</a>.
