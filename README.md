# aaroncharlton.github.io
This is my site. It is hosted at <a href="https://aaroncharlton.com/">aaroncharlton.com</a>. My goal was to simplify. Now I mainly link to all my projects and just have a one-page site. Note that I also have a 404 page but it's pretty basic too.
### Skins
There are currently two different versions of the css. You can either go with "lightblue.css" or "red.css." To change between the two, you can edit the <head> section of both the index and 404 pages to link to the appropriate css file. It should have links to both normalize.css and either lightblue.css or red.css.  
### About the CV link
You can just link to the Google Doc where you maintain your resume or cv. The link can be configured to <a href="https://eduk8.me/2016/06/link-google-doc-view-pdf-browser/">automatically export the doc as a pdf and download it</a>.
### License
The code is free for anybody to use.
